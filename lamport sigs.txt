Generate private key:
[256][256]...[256] n = 256

Generate public key = hash of private key

Give out public key. Nobody can get private from it.

Given msg:
Sign by selecting private key blocks 
to reveal based on bits in message hash

Everyone now has signature and public key

Only you know private key, and evyerone only knows
private key corresponding to specific msg

Nobody can forge unless they want to sign the
exact same message b.c hash(other msg) != hash(msg)

Anybody can verify by chechking against public key...
following msg hash

If signature is false, some sig block wont hash
to corresponding public key

If signature is correct, all sig block will hash to
corresponding publick key block
